# üèÜ Day Streaks

Maintaining day-streaks is a cornerstone in the process of learning new languages. It utilizes the power of habit to ensure continuous progress and solidifies daily engagement with the language being learned.

## How It Works

Here‚Äôs the breakdown of maintaining day-streaks effectively:

* **Stay Online Daily:** Users are encouraged to log into the app at least once a day, fostering a routine.
* **Increment Restrictions:** Day-streaks grow by only one increment (+1) each day, underscoring the value of consistency over sporadic long sessions.
* **Irreversible Losses:** Once a day-streak is broken, it cannot be recovered. This rule cements the importance of not missing a single day.

This approach transforms the overwhelming task of learning a new language into manageable, daily investments of time and effort.

## Token Calculation

Engagement and progression are also incentivized through a unique token calculation system. This system uses the length of your day-streak as a multiplier in a [formula](../token/distibution/#formula) that determines your token earnings. Therefore, maintaining a long day-streak not only signifies consistent learning but also rewards users with more tokens, enhancing the overall learning experience with tangible rewards.

## Leaderboard üèÜ

To inject an element of motivation and competition among learners, the app features a Global Leaderboard. This leaderboard ranks users based on the length of their day-streaks, providing a graphical comparison of dedication levels across the globe. Climbing the ranks of the Global Leaderboard or simply watching your progress can serve as a powerful motivator, pushing learners to maintain their daily engagement and extend their day-streaks further.

To compare your progress with others, simply tap your day-streak in your profile to open the Global Leaderboard. This quick access offers a motivational glance at your worldwide ranking, encouraging you to maintain and extend your learning streak.

In essence, the focus on maintaining day-streaks offers an effective method for building and sustaining the habit of language learning. Through its simple yet strict rules, it encourages daily dedication, rewards consistency, and fosters a competitive yet supportive community of language learners worldwide.
