## LangX: The Economy-Token of the Language-Exchange Platform

[LangX](../) stands as the proprietary economy-token for its namesake platformâ€”a unique, free, open-source, and community-driven arena for language exchange. This document aims to shed light on all aspects of LangX, offering a comprehensive overview for newcomers and existing users alike.

_**Introduction**_ [LangX](../) is the economy-token of the even-named, free, opensource and community-driven language-exchange platform. Even though the supply is limited it is still meant as encouragement for users of the app to increase their knowledge about languages and cultures of other people, countries and groups. Depending on their activity on the app, the development and growth of the community and their consistency in learning one will earn more and more of the token. The formula for the calculation is found later on this page.

### Why?

We, as a community, have decided to develop an own token for multiple reasons.

* Users can earn tokens and seamlessly transfer them to their wallets for trading, embracing a [learn-to-earn](broken-reference) model through [Web 3.0 ](../library/technology/web-3.0.md)and [blockchain](../library/technology/blockchain.md) technologies. Many platforms offer alternative or unique ecosystem tokens, but later restrict access through paywalls or limitations, eroding trust in the crypto market. Our mission is to restore faith in cryptocurrencies by providing a transparent and unrestricted token ecosystem.
* To enhance user engagement and broaden their knowledge base, the platform should both incentivize active participation and facilitate learning.
* Currently, we are the only language exchange platform that utilizes an actual token system.
