## Utility of Tokens

This dual functionality not only enhances the immediate learning experience but also builds a supportive and appreciative community of learners. As LangX tokens become more integrated into different aspects of the platform, from exclusive market transactions to potential savings mechanisms, their value extends beyond mere currency. They represent a commitment to ongoing education, mutual respect among users, and an open-minded approach to the evolving digital economy. The future implementation of a marketplace further solidifies their position as a vital component of the LangX ecosystem, offering users unique ways to personalize their learning experience and engage with the community. Through these diverse applications, LangX tokens are not just facilitating transactions; they are enriching the educational journey, fostering a vibrant community, and bridging the gap between learning and real-world application.

### Overview

1. The primary use of LangX tokens is to enhance one's learning experience and knowledge progression with our AI support tool, [**Copilot**](../library/language-copilot.md). Users can interact not only with real people but also with an AI that responds in real-time, providing a continuous learning opportunity, regardless of the availability of other users.
2. LangX tokens can also be used as a reward system, allowing users to send tokens to each other as a form of appreciation for help or services provided during practice sessions.
3. In the future, we plan to implement a marketplace for platform-exclusive emoticons and expressions, where LangX tokens will be the only accepted currency.
4. Similar to traditional saving accounts, LangX Tokens can be [staked](staking.md) in the world of cryptocurrency.
5. Lastly, users can withdraw their LangX tokens to their personal [wallet](../library/technology/wallet.md) and either purchase more tokens or sell them on the market while [trading](trading.md).
